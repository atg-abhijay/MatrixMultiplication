### Matrix
## by Abhijay Gupta

The repository right now contains MatrixMultiplication.java that multiplies two 2x2 matrices, MatrixMultiplicationGeneral.java that can multiply two nxn matrices, SystemOfEquations.java that gives the solution to a system of 3 equations with 3 variables.

Matrix.java defines an object which includes various methods defined on it like - multiplying two matrices of any sizes, finding the solution for a system of equations, transposing the matrix and row-reducing the matrix. TestingMatrix.java is the place where the Matrix file is getting tested.
